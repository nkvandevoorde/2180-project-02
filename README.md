# 2180-project-02
Least Squares Project
Objectives: 
1. load in data
2. find non-zero columns (features)
3. construct A matix and y vector for ||A(theta) - y||2
4. test using 5000 images from test data and calculate error rate and false positives/negatives
5. repeat 1-4 on 100 images of training data -> how did error rate and false positives/negatives change
6. Create a new feature vector M0 with M = 5000 and retrain least squares algorithm using these features
7. Run algorithm at M = 20, 50, 1000, 5000, and 10000. Calculate error rate and false positives/negatives for each
